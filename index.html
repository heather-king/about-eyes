        <h2> What do the eyes do?</h2>
        <p> Eyes are organs that help us to see. They help us to see words in a book so we can read. 
        They allow us to see the various colors that surround us daily. Some people believe
        that they are openings into the soul.</p>

        <h2> Parts of the eye</h2>
        <p> These are the parts of the eye that work together to help you see:</p>
<ul>
    <li> Sclera - the white part of the eye </li>
    <li> Iris - the colored part of the eye </li>
    <li> Pupil - hole though which light passes through the eye </li>
    <li> Lens - focuses the light in the eye </li>
    <li> Retina - nerve that lines the back of the eye. Sends signals to the brain</li>
    
</ul>

            <h2> How do eyes work?</h2>
            
            <p> In order for your eyes to function, they must let in light through
            pupil and into the back of the eye. The lens then helps to focus the light, sort of like a camera. This light then focuses on a single point 
            on the retina which then sends millions of signals to the brain which interprets the image. Of course there are a million other functions that
            take place, but this is the simplest way to explain it.

                <h2> Eye Colors & Shapes</h2>
                <p> The great thing about eyes is that they come in all different shapes and colors. The most common
            eye shapes are typically:
            
                <ul>
                <li> Almond</li>
                <li> Round</li>
                <li> Upturned</li>
                <li> Downturned</li>
                </ul>
            
            Typically eyes shapes do not affect vision, though in rare cases they can. Per the image below, you can see 
            that there are more defined shapes than listed but they all start from the four listed.

             <p> Eye colors can also vary greatly. Typically eyes are brown, green, blue, but there are a million shades
         that can occur in between. There are even people who have two different color eyes! </p>
